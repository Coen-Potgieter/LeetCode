- FIRST LCA PROBLEM...


Problem:
    - Given unordered Binary Tree
    - Given p & q, must find lowest common ancestor between p & q

Constraints:
    - all nodes unique
    - p != q
    - p & q always exist in the tree

Plan:
    - Idea 1:
        - Thought of some bfs thing where we populate each level in their own array
        - then determine lca using the halfs of each array or something like this
    - Idea 2:
        - Start on root node
        - do binary search on left subtree
            - if both found then go one level deeper 
            - if none found then check right subtree
            - if one found then of the node we are on is the LCA???
        - Lets see if this works...
