- This is tries?
- I know how sliding windows work and this looks like smallest subarray sum larger than S a little bit
- So gonna use a dynamiccally sized sliding window


- constraints:  
    - length of string: [0, 5*10^5]
    - s contanis letters, digits, symbols, spaces

- Plan:
    - slide window then check for unqiue chars in substring
        - only way i can think of checking for unqiue substring is populating an array or something and checking like this
