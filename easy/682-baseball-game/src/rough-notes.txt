- Don't really need a stack here. 
- Just need an array the size of the given input then populate the array 

- Nothing really special here

- +: sum prev 2 scores
- D: double prev score
- C: Remove last score

- constraints:
    1. num Ops: [1, 1000]
    2. possible ops: int or +,D,C
    3. No edge cases for +, there will always be 2 prev scores available to add
    4. same for D & C, there will always be scores before them
