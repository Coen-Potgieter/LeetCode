- if the first half of the list = the second half of the list
- constraints:
    1. num nodes = [1, 10^5]
    2. Node valie = [1, 9]


- Plan:
    - Could brute force this
        1. Separate vector to store all values
        2. Get size of vector at the end
        3. Divide the vector into 2 and check for equality
        - Lets try this
