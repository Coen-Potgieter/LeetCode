- we get money and children both ints
- rules to distr money
    1. all money distr
    2. every gets at least 1 dollar
    3. no one gets exactly 4 dollars

- Return max # of children who may get exaclty 8 dollars according to above rules
- If no distr then return -1

- constraints
    - 1 <= money <= 200
    - 2 <= children <= 30



- Plan
    - See how many kids can get 8 each then check constraints
    - Make a final array of full distributions then check all constraints on that array
