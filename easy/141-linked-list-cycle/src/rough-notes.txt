- determine if there is a cycle
- return true if cycle otherwise false
- constraints:
    1. num nodes in a given list: [0, 10^4]
    2. values are trivial
    3. pos is some index or -1 of there is no cycle

- plan:
    - keep track of seen pointers in a separate array and check if we have seen it
        - I think this would work
    - They want O(1) memory though
        - Maybe cycle through 10^4 times, if we havent reach null ptr then there must be a loop
        - This will be slow though?
