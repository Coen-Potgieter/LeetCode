- Reverse the order of a linked list
- Starting at head

- Constraints
    1. num Nodes: [0, 5000]
    2. vals are trivial

- plan:
    - Need 3 pointers:
        1. A Traveler (this will allows us to move to the next node)
        2. A Changing (this will be what we are chaning)
        3. Point to (this will be what we change to)
    - Need to figure out what happens when we have less than 3 nodes though
