- Only trick here is the pushing
    - I think i could have change the popping but still would mean linear runtime
- when pusing create a new queue and copy all the elems from the old queue into there
- This keeps the most recently added elem at the `front` of our queue (or rather at the `top` of our stack)
- The rest of the methods should be trivial
