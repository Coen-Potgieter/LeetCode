- similar story here as with implementing a stack with a queue
    - either popping will be slow
    - or inserting will be slow

- I think we will push less so lets make that slow

- Thoughts
    - stack has one `top`
    - queue has `front` and `back` where:
        - push: at `back`
        - pop: at `front`
    - so i need push to happen at the bottom of the stack, and everything is fine
    - this means create 
    - should have read the thing
        - it says using 2 stacks but i though my thinking was bad
    - We need to change either popping or pushing...
        - i did pushing for the last problem (implement queue using stacks)
        - so thus i will change popping
    - no matter what we do we need to reverse the stack

    - FUCK:
        - I need to change the push rather than the pop
        - since peeking requires the `front` of the list
        - this means that the `top` of our stack should align with the `front` of our queue
