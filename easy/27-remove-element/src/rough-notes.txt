- Remove all instances of `val`
- Order does not matter
- return number of elements that are not `val`

- conditions of success:
    - first k elems are not `val`
    - return k

- constraints
    - nums.length = [0,100]
    - elem of nums = [0,50]
    - val = [0,100]

- Plan
    - itterate through array
    - When we find an element with the value we swap with last element
    - increase k
