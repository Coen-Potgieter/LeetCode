- Given `nums` vector is ordered in ascedning order
- Remove duplicates
- order kept the same
- Use in-place meaning no new array created
- Return number of unique elements

- conditions for success
    - first k elems are unique
    - The elements k - inf are not important
    - The size of nums is not important
    - we just need to return k and sort the array properly

- constraints 
    1. nums.length = [1, 3*10^4]
    2. nums[i] = [-100, 100]
    3. nums sorted in ascending order
